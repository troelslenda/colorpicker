colorpicker
===========

jQuery - ColorPicker http://www.eyecon.ro/colorpicker/

There numerous repositories on github featuring this colorpicker but most of them are altered in some way.

Since Drush make is having a hardtime with zip files, I needed this repository to deploy some sites.

Unmaintained, the original jQuery plugin seems so aswell.
